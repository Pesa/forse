From FORSE's top-level directory do the following steps:

[ T1, T2 and T3 are three different terminal emulators. ]

1) Run `./start_bootstrap_server.sh` in T1.
2) Run `./start_worker_node.sh` in T2.
3) Execute 'bootstrap_server:bootstrap(Laps, Speedup).' inside the erlang
   shell in T1; Laps and Speedup are positive integer values.
4) Optionally run `./start_logger_gui.sh` and/or `./start_race_info_gui.sh`.
5) Execute 'scheduler:start_simulation().' inside one of the erlang shells
   and the simulation should start.
