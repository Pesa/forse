[ T1, T2 and T3 are three different terminal emulators. ]

1) Run `./start_bootstrap_server.sh` in T1.
2) Run `./start_worker_node.sh` in T2.
3) Execute 'bootstrap_server:bootstrap(Laps, Speedup).' inside the erlang
   shell in T1; Laps and Speedup are positive integer values.
4) Run `./start_logger_gui.sh` in T3.
5) Hit the "Connect" button in the "Debug Log" GUI.
6) Execute 'scheduler:start_simulation().' inside the erlang shell in T2
